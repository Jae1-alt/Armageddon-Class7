## Auditor Narrative

This architecture achieves strict Data Residency compliance by physically isolating the persistence layer (RDS) exclusively within the Tokyo region (ap-northeast-1), satisfying local APPI jurisdiction requirements. To serve Latin American users without violating residency laws, we employ a 'Stateless Spoke' model in São Paulo. The São Paulo application servers act merely as transient processors; they ingest user requests and tunnel them securely via a private Transit Gateway (TGW) corridor back to Tokyo. This ensures that while data is processed near the user for performance, it is never stored at rest outside of Japan. Furthermore, the perimeter is hardened using CloudFront with WAF at the edge, ensuring that malicious traffic is dropped before it ever enters the cross-region corridor, protecting the expensive inter-region bandwidth and the internal application logic.
