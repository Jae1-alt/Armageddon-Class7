### **Part 3: Incident Response

**Incident Summary**

- **What failed?** The connectivity between the Application Layer (EC2) and the Data Layer (RDS) was severed due to a missing Inbound Security Group rule on TCP Port 3306.
    
- **How was it detected?** The `DBConnectionErrors` metric exceeded the threshold of 3, triggering the CloudWatch Alarm `lab-db-connection-failure`, which notified the operations team via SNS (Email).
    
- **Root Cause:** Security Group configuration drift (Human Error).
    
- **Time to Recovery (MTTR):** ~ 11 Minutes
    
    - **Detection:** 12:04 PM (Alarm triggered via SNS email).
        
    - **Diagnosis:** 12:04 PM – 12:10 PM (Verified logs for "Timeout" errors and validated SSM/Secrets Manager).
        
    - **Remediation:** 12:12 PM (Restored missing Security Group rule).
        
    - **Verification:** 12:15 PM (Confirmed `/list` endpoint accessibility and Alarm transition to `OK`).
    

**Preventive Action**

1. **Reduce MTTR:** Implement a "Known Good" Security Group that can be hot-swapped onto the RDS instance during emergencies, rather than manually editing rules.
    
2. **Prevent Recurrence:** Implement **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/CloudFormation)** and **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** for managing security groups and core infrastructure. This transition will eliminate manual configuration errors, prevent drift, and enable automated **'Configuration Drift Detection'** to alert the operations team _before_ a service failure occurs.
