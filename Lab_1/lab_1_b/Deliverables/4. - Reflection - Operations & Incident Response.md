### A) Why might Parameter Store still exist alongside Secrets Manager?

Response:

While both services are key-value stores, they are designed for different data lifecycles and cost profiles. AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (Standard) is largely free, making it the ideal choice for storing non-sensitive configuration data such as database endpoints, AMI IDs, or feature flags. In contrast, AWS Secrets Manager costs $0.40 per secret per month, a price justified by its specialized security features.

Secrets Manager provides native integration with AWS database services to enable **automatic credential rotation**, encryption, and management. By using both, an organization can follow a "Separation of Concerns" strategy: non-sensitive metadata stays in the cost-effective Parameter Store, while high-stakes credentials (like passwords or API keys) are secured in Secrets Manager. This ensures that an engineer who only needs to know _where_ a database is located does not automatically gain access to _how_ to log into it.

### B) What breaks first during secret rotation?

Response:

During a secret rotation event, the Application Connectivity (specifically the application's cache) is usually the first thing to break. When Secrets Manager rotates a password, it updates the database immediately. However, the application running on an EC2 instance typically caches the current credentials in local memory to avoid constant API calls.

When the rotation occurs, the database begins expecting the _new_ password, but the application continues to send the _old_ (stale) password from its cache. This mismatch results in the `Access Denied` (Error 1045) observed during the lab.

- **Best Practice:** To mitigate this, application code should implement a **"Fetch-on-Failure"** retry logic. If the app receives an authentication error, it should immediately re-fetch the latest secret value from Secrets Manager before reporting a hard failure.

### C) Why should alarms be based on symptoms instead of causes?

Response:

Alarms should prioritize symptoms (the end-user experience) over causes (internal system metrics) to maximize actionability and reduce "Alarm Fatigue."

- **Cause-based monitoring** (e.g., High CPU) can be noisy; a server might hit 90% CPU during a scheduled task while the application remains perfectly healthy, leading to unnecessary alerts.
    
- **Symptom-based monitoring** (e.g., Database Connection Failures) ensures that an alarm only triggers when there is a measurable impact on the business or the user.
    

By alerting on the symptom, you create a "catch-all" for any underlying cause—whether it is a bad password, a network timeout, or a database crash—ensuring that every alert is meaningful and requires a response.

### D) How does this lab reduce Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)?

Response:

This lab architecture optimizes the incident response lifecycle in three key ways:

1. **Immediate Detection:** The SNS-triggered alarm notifies administrators the instant an error threshold is exceeded, cutting down the time a system sits in a failed state before human intervention.
    
2. **Rapid Diagnosis:** By using **Centralized Logging** with specific filter patterns (e.g., `DB_CONNECTION_FAILURE`), root causes such as "timeouts" or "refused connections" are identified instantly. This removes the need for time-consuming manual log hunting across multiple servers.
    
3. **Decoupled Remediation:** Storing credentials and endpoints in **SSM** and **Secrets Manager** allows for "no-code" fixes. An engineer can update a password or restore a security group rule and see an instant recovery without having to re-deploy or re-start the application code.

### E) What would you automate next?

Response:

The logical next step in maturing this architecture is Automated Remediation via AWS Lambda.

I would configure the CloudWatch Alarm to trigger a Lambda function that parses the specific error message. For instance, if the log shows a timed out error, the Lambda could cross-reference the RDS Security Group against a "known good" configuration template stored in AWS Config. If it detects that the required ingress rule (Port 3306) has been deleted, the Lambda would automatically re-apply the rule. This "self-healing" mechanism can resolve connectivity issues in under 30 seconds, providing a recovery that is faster and more consistent than human intervention.
